# Planner Sidekick AI

## About The Project

This project is a personal calendar application, inspired by Google Calendar, but designed to be smarter, more intuitive, and free of frustrating quirks. It started from a simple annoyance: Google Calendar's habit of assuming an event ending after 9 PM should continue until 9 AM the next day. This project is about building a calendar that adapts to the user, not the other way around.

The core functionality allows users to add, manage, and group tasks and events. The real magic, however, will come from an integrated agentic AI chatbot built with LangChain. This AI assistant will help with complex scheduling and planning, turning a simple calendar into a true sidekick.

### Planned AI Features

*   **Automated Schedule Population**: Feed the AI a syllabus or document, and it will automatically populate your calendar with important dates.
*   **Collaborative Task Management**: Coordinate chores with roommates or tasks with a team, letting the AI handle fair division and scheduling.
